# Issue: Advanced Analysis Features

## Summary
Expand analysis capabilities for deeper insights into audio sessions.

## Tasks
- [ ] Integrate ECAPA-TDNN diarization model (Iteration 2).
- [ ] Improve marker scoring and confirmation mechanisms.
- [ ] Integrate an LLM to generate richer summaries.
- [ ] Optimize real-time processing for low-latency feedback.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Diarization produces accurate speaker segmentation with ECAPA-TDNN.
- Marker system evaluates and confirms markers with improved reliability.
- Summaries generated via LLM enhance clarity over current methods.
- Real-time processing maintains responsiveness under typical workloads.

## Priority
